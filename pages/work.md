   <h1>Work</h1>
    
    For the past few years, I've been working at the Government Digital Service. I like to fix the basics. Something else, something else, probably.

    Since 2016 I've been working on improving the GOV.UK platform.

   <h3 id="project-1"><a href="/template">A simpler, clearer GOV.UK</a></h3>
   
    We wanted to make GOV.UK better for users, but this was difficult: inconsistent designs and more than 100 templates made iterating at scale impossible.

    My team consolidated 140 unique page templates, improving their design and accessibility. These fixes made the site easier to use and to work on.  

   <h3 id="project-2"><a href="/taxonomy">Improving users journeys</a></h3>

    A reduced number of templates paved the way for us to make more foundational improvements. My team rationalised the IA and implemented machine generated related links across all content.

   <h3 id="project-3"><a href="/content-types">Exploring GOV.UK as a system</a></h3>

    The team created a new, overarching taxonomy to sit across the different parts of the site, allowing us to unify and serve all content in one place.
