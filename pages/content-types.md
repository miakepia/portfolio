   <h1>Exploring GOV.UK as a system</h1>
    
    By 2021, GOV.UK had gone through two major crisis response projects: Brexit and Covid-19. We’d paused our work on the platform, moving fast to deliver much needed content and services to users.

   <h2>The challenge</h2>

    The pace and chaos of these projects led to building bespoke solutions rather than iterating, and we’d started to undo much of our work to streamline and improve the site.

    When the dust settled, we knew we had to make a range of updates to platform and how we worked on it. 

    I collaborated with design and product leadership to define the GOV.UK strategy for 2022–23. A key focus of the strategy is to ‘fix the basics’, laying the foundations for ambitious future delivery that depends on a solid, resilient platform.

   <h2>What we did</h2>

    We launched a discovery to investigate how to build tools and processes around the foundations of GOV.UK: what it does, how it fits together and how people work on it.

    I worked with stakeholders to shape the brief and helped the team define, scope and deliver the work.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    Interviews with publishers revealed that many were misusing content types because they weren't fit for purpose. This hinders navigation by undermining the IA. 

    These issues were exacerbated by teams using fragmented resources: tech docs, component libraries and content guidance were siloed and contradictory .

    Finally, there was little information on how past decisions were made, or why.

  <h3>We explored structured content</h3>

    Publishers needed content types that had flexible features. To achieve this, we explored how to structure content and separate it from its presentation. 

    Structured content also unlocks content distribution across the site, meaning we could build personalised features for users who have signed in and shared their data with us.

  <h3>We prototyped flexible templates</h3>

    We designed and prototyped a template to deliver several different content types. Features are controlled by the publisher, providing greater flexibility and reducing content type misuse. 
    
    Publishing would be controlled with permissions instead of needing separate applications for different content types.

  <h3>We piloted better documentation</h3>

    Research revealed that there were no standard processes for teams on GOV.Uk to rely on when working. Many people didn’t know what resources existed, and knowledge often disappeared when team members left.   

    Most pressingly, we needed a way to make sure that work done was always aligned with the GOV.UK strategy. Teams needed to understand the why, not just the how of decision making.

    We started pulling together all the known documentation and rewriting it in a user centred way. We also began to tease out a long-term governance model by exposing the parts, people and process of working on GOV.UK.

  <h2>Outcomes</h2>

    To make teams fall in love with these ideas, we brought them to life with stories, prototypes and future scenarios.

    Our deliverables were crafted to work separately and together so they can be widely shared and used to influence decisions at all levels. 

    It was important to bring people along, and teams were invited to collaborative sessions to brainstorm how these ideas would enable their work.
