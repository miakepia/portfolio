   <h1>A simpler, clearer GOV.UK</h1>
  
    We wanted to make GOV.UK better for users, but this was difficult: inconsistent designs and more than 100 templates made iterating at scale impossible.

   <h2>The challenge</h2>

    Five years after GOV.UK was launched, users visiting GOV.UK were struggling to deal with an unpredictable and inaccessible experience. 
    
    The front-end had become complicated and difficult for both designers and developers to make sense of. Many told us they didnâ€™t understand how each template worked or what it did. The sheer number of templates also made accessibility and layout improvements difficult.

   <h2>What we did</h2>
   <h3>Research and design audit</h3>

    To get started, I combed through five years of research on GOV.UK. This helped us to see the bigger picture and approach the problem holistically.

    Our starting goal was to reduce the number of uniqe content page layouts on the site. Content pages are the most useful, and used, by visitors to GOV.UK. They were made up of 140 unique page templates, all with different design elements.

    Our new designs also aimed to be accessible. We reviewed the current templates and layouts and found a number of issues that needed fixing.

   <figcaption class="right">We used <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/understanding-disabilities-and-impairments-user-profiles">accessibility profiles</a> to help us review the templates for accessibility issues. We also tested on a range of devices, which gave us much-needed insight into how users of older technology experience the site.</figcaption>

  <h3>Consolidated and tested designs</h3>

    To achieve our goal of creating accessible, consistent and usable layouts, we stripped the designs back and used as few elements as possible.  

    We made improvements to the accessibility by applying global changes to the typography, links, focus states and semantic structure of the templates. 

    We used a range of methods to test our designs and measure success, including:
  <ul>
    <li>Internal confidence surveys</li>
    <li>Usability testing with users on mobile and desktop.</li>
    <li>AB tests to measure the success of layouts and components at scale</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Outcomes</h2>

    We reduced the number of unique layouts from 140 to 10, making it more straightforward for teams to iterate GOV.UK at pace. A smaller number of layouts and design elements also meant we could simplify the front-end architecture. 

    User experience improved as the predictable design allowed users to focus on the content they needed.

    Accessibility improvements to font size, touch targets, colour contrast and layout improved the mobile experience as well. 
    
    Developer and designer confidence in making changes increased, and teams felt less stressed and more able to innovate.

   This work helped kick off the first, early explorations for a <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a>. The streamlined design and front-end also laid the foundations for simpler publishing tools, unified navigation and rapid iteration at scale.
