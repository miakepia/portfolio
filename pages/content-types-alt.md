   <h1>Exploring a GOV.UK experience system</h1>
    
    By 2021, GOV.UK had gone through two major crisis response projects: Brexit and Covid-19. We’d paused our work on the platform, moving fast to deliver much needed content and services to users.

   <h2>The challenge</h2>

    The pace and chaos of these projects led to building bespoke solutions rather than iterating, and we’d started to undo much of our work to streamline and improve the system.

    When the dust settled, we knew we had to make a range of updates to platform and how we worked on it.

      Drawing on the work done in 2017–18, I collaborated with design and product leadership to define the GOV.UK strategy for 2022–23. A key focus of the strategy is to ‘fix the basics’, laying the foundations for ambitious future delivery that depends on a solid, resilient platform.

   <h2>What we did</h2>

    We launched a discovery to investigate how to build tools and processes around the foundations of GOV.UK: what it does, how it fits together and how people work on it.

    I worked with stakeholders to shape the brief and helped the team define, scope and deliver the work.

    <h3>Research</h3>

    Interviews with publishers revealed that most hacking or misusing content types is often necessary—the GOV.UK publishing apps are siloed, and many publishers don’t have access to needed features. 

    Misuse of content types hinders search and related links by miscategorising content and undermining the IA. This was exacerbated by teams changing content types in ways that went against their purpose. 

    Resources were fragmented and contradictory: technical documentation, component libraries and content guidance used different terminology, creating confusion. 

    There was also little governance around who made decisions, and what those decisions were based on.

  <h3>Explored structured features</h3>

    Publishers needed content types that were scoped in purpose but flexible in features. To achieve this flexibility, we explored how to structure content and separate it from its presentation. 

    We developed typologies to guide our content types. Instead of individual types with their own templates, the typologies could express a range of features.

    Syncing with the publishing permissions team, we prototyped a flexible template to deliver five different content types. The published content is determined by which features the publisher chooses.

    Structured content also unlocks content distribution across the site and external technologies. This will be used to build personalised guidance for users who are signed in and have given permission to use data they’ve made available.

  <h3>We prototyped flexible templates</h3>

    Syncing with a different team’s work on publishing permissions, we prototyped a flexible template to deliver a range of content types. The published content is determined by which features the publisher chooses, providing greater flexibility and reducing misuse. 

    Using flexible templates risks a chaotic situation where publishers do as they please. To address this, we developed a range of content ‘typologies’ — each with defined use cases, features and usability considerations. Typologies keep content types organised and tightly scoped in line with their purpose.

  <h3>Shaped an ‘experience system'</h3>

    Research revealed that there were no standard processes for teams on GOV.Uk to rely on when working. 

    Many people didn’t know what resources existed, and knowledge often disappeared when team members left.   

    Most pressingly, we needed a way to make sure that work done was always aligned with the GOV.UK strategy. Teams needed to understand the why, not just the how of decision making.

    We started pulling together all the known documentation and rewriting it in a user friendly way. We also began to tease out a long-term governance model by exposing the parts, people and process working on GOV.UK.

  <h2>Outcomes</h2>

    To make other teams fall in love with these problems, we brought the recommendations to life with stories, prototypes and future scenarios.

    The report, recommendations and prototypes were all crafted to work separately and together. We understood that these things are often widely shared and used to influence decisions at many levels. 

    Teams were provided with a loose structure for their documentation, and feedback processes were put in place to discuss how to improve and iterate. Regular pairing and sharing of work helps embed better ways of working.
